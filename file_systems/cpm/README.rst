CP/M File Systems
=================


There are several different file systems used by different versions of CP/M. The
following is a list of the formats I aspire to support.

* `1.4 <https://www.seasip.info/Cpm/format14.html>`_
* `2.2 <https://www.seasip.info/Cpm/format22.html>`_
* `3.1 <https://www.seasip.info/Cpm/format31.html>`_
* `4.1 <https://www.seasip.info/Cpm/format41.html>`_


General documentation of formats can be found `here <https://www.seasip.info/Cpm/formats.html>`_.
More detailed documentation for an unspecified version is `here <http://www.cpm8680.com/cpmtools/cpm.htm>`_.
