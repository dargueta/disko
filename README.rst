Disko -- A Disk Image Manager
=============================

This is purely for the purpose of my learning Go and I don't want to have just one copy
on my hard drive. This should not be taken seriously at all. Don't use it.

Features
--------

Currently this only supports reading from FAT 12, 16, and 32 images.

License

Against my better judgement I'm making this open-source for anyone to use at their own
peril. This is released under the terms of the BSD 3-Clause License. Please see
